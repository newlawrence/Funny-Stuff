# Funny Stuff

Just as the title says: **Get fun!!!**

This is a place to hold all those weird things borned from my crazy mind, now public for all of you.

It is a collection of tests, old projects, programming lessons... and more. One things are in spanish other in english; I'm so sorry about this mix of languages, but things remains untouched keeping their original esence from the moment when I created them.

It is my wish to find all the code I wrote in the past and collect them here where, far from get lost, it can be useful for someone.

Feel free to navigate and share.

Ah, it's true. This is Open Source so... ***don't forget to mind the licenses ;)***
