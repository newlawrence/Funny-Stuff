- About Splash WhatsApp:
    Splash WhatsApp its a very simple WhatsApp listener client that displays
    messages and images, received from a desired phone number, using the
    WhatsApp API for Python Yowsup (by Tarek Galal). Those messages are shown in
    screen as splash screens.

- Remarks:
    The registration password for the local phone number (the one who is going
    to receive the messages) is required. I strongly recommend to get a new
    number, not associated to WhatsApp yet, to register to the service and
    obtain that password. There are lots of tutorials showing how to achieve
    this using Yowsup on the internet.

- Requirements:
    Python3
    dateutil
    PyQt5 / PyQt4 / PySide
    Yowsup (included with the source)
