# SEMEP

**SEMEP** stands for Simple and Extensible Math Expressions Parser.

It's a mathematical expressions parser written in **C++** which I made in the past (*2013, September*) to improve my skills with the language. It allows the creation and use of ***user defined functions***.

Bindings for **C** are built inside the code. Another binding for **Fortran 95/2003** is provided.

To test the library, copy all its code into the `example` folder and type `make` (**GNU Make** properly installed is needed).

Code is lincesed under **MIT License**.
