    "# Python Descriptors Demystified\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Chris Beaumont](http://chrisbeaumont.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python includes many built-in language features to enable concise, easily-understood code. Some of these niceties include list/set/dictionary comprehensions, properties, and decorators. For the most part, these \"intermediate-level\" language features are well-documented, and easy to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one notable exception to this: **descriptors**. For me at least, descriptors were the  feature of the core Python language that remained mysterious for the longest time. There are a few reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. The [official documentation on descriptors](http://docs.python.org/2/howto/descriptor.html) is rather esoteric, and doesn't include good use cases for *why* you might write descriptors (My apologies to Raymond Hettinger, whose *other* Python articles and videos I have found very helpful).\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. The syntax for writing descriptors is a little weird.\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. Custom descriptors might be the least-utilized feature of the Python language, so it's hard to find good examples in open source projects.\n",
    " \n",
    "Nevertheless, descriptors **do** have their use once you figure them out. This document tries to build the argument for what descriptors do, and why you should care.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The punchline: descriptors are reusable properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we're building up to: fundamentally, descriptors are properties that you can reuse. That is, descriptors let you write code that looks like this"

    "We specify a getter method with a `@property` decorator, and a setter method with a `@budget.setter` decorator.

Likewise Python automatically calls `budget.setter` whenever it encounters code like `m.budget = value`.\n",

    "Take a moment to appreciate how nice it is that Python does this: if properties didn't exist, we'd have to hide all of our instance attributes, and provide lots of explicit methods like `get_budget` and `set_budget`. Code that uses our classes would constantly be calling these getter/setter methods, and would start to look like crufty Java code. Even worse, if we ignored this coding style and just gave direct access to an instance attribute like `budget`, there would be no clean way to later add the non-negativity check -- we would have to retroactively create the `set_budget` method, and search our entire project to change lines like `m.budget = value` to `m.set_budget(value)`. **Gross.**\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "There's some new syntax in here, so let's look at things piece by piece:\n",
    "\n",
    "`NonNegative` is a descriptor object. It's a descriptor because it defines the `__get__`, `__set__`, or `__delete__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Movie` class looks *very* clean. We create 4 descriptors at the class level, and treat them like normal (instance-level) attributes everywhere else. And apparently, the desciptors are checking for non-negative values for us.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Accessing a descriptor\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python sees the line ``print m.budget``, it recognizes that budget is a descriptor with a `__get__` method. Instead of passing `m.budget` to print directly, it calls `Movie.budget.__get__`, and feeds the result of *that* to print. This is similar to what happens when you access a property -- Python automatically calls a method, and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__get__` receives two arguments: the instance object to the left of the period (that is, the `m` object in `m.budget`), and the type of that instance (`Movie`). In some Python [documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#implementing-descriptors), `Movie` is called the **owner** of the descriptor. If we had asked for `Movie.budget`, Python whould have called `Movie.budget.__get__(None, Movie)`; that is, the fist argument is either an instance of the owner, or ```None```. These input arguments may seem weird to you, but they're there to give you information about what object the descriptor is part of. This will make sense once we look inside the `NonNegative` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assigning to a descriptor\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python sees `m.rating = 100`, Python recognizes `rating` is a descriptor with a ``__set__`` method, and it calls `Movie.rating.__set__(m, 100)`. Like `__get__`, the first argument of `__set__` is the instance to the left of the period (the `m` in `m.rating = 100`). The second argument is the value to the right of the equals sign (100). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deleting a descriptor\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of completeness, if you call `del m.budget`, Python will call `Movie.budget.__delete__(m)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How NonNegative works\n",
    "With this in mind, we can now look to see how the `NonNegative` class works. Each instance of `NonNegative` maintains a dictionary that maps owner instances to data values. When we call `m.budget`, the `__get__` method looks up the data associated with `m`, and returns the result (or a default value, if no such value exists). `__set__` uses the same approach, but includes the extra non-negativity check. We use a `WeakKeyDictionary` instead of a normal `dict` to prevent a memory leak -- we don't want an instance to stay alive simply because it's in the descriptor dictionary, and otherwise unused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with descriptors is slightly awkward. Because they live at the class level, every instance shares the same descriptor. This means that descriptors have to manually manage different states for different object instances, and need to explicitly be passed instances as the first argument of the `__get__`, ``__set__``, and ``__delete__`` methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, however, this example gives you an idea of what descriptors can be useful for -- they provide a way to organize property logic into isolated classes. If you find yourself repeating the same logic across several properties, that should be a clue to consider whether refactoring that code into a descriptor is worthwhile."
